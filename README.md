🧪 Lab Instructions: SUIS Data Governance Framework
Overview
This lab simulates daily data governance tasks for a classified UAV intelligence system. It is modeled after the responsibilities of a Data Governance Engineer supporting DoD and defense-sector organizations like Lockheed Martin.

You will validate, monitor, and enforce metadata and access policies using:

Python

Pandas

YAML

Windows Task Scheduler (for automation)

Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed

pandas library (pip install pandas)

VS Code or Notepad++

Excel (or LibreOffice Calc)

Windows Task Scheduler access

✅ Getting Started
1. Clone or Download This Repo
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/suis-data-governance-lab.git
Or download the ZIP and extract the contents.

2. Install Dependencies
Open PowerShell or Command Prompt:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas
3. Run the Data Validator Script
bash
Copy
Edit
cd scripts
python validate_data_with_logging.py
It will:

Check for missing fields

Validate GPS coordinate format

Ensure allowed threat levels

Log the results in ../validation_log.txt

4. Review the Log File
Open validation_log.txt to see:

Timestamped entries

Validation PASS/FAIL results

Details of any issues found

5. Review Governance Policies
data_dictionary.xlsx: Describes each field, owner, and classification

metadata_standards.yaml: Defines field types and required standards

access_policy.yaml: Defines role-based data access (Zero Trust)

data_governance_policy.md: Summary of compliance and governance models

6. Automate Daily Compliance Checks
Use Task Scheduler to run the validator every morning:

Trigger: Daily at 9:00 AM
Action:

Program: python.exe

Arguments: C:\Path\To\validate_data_with_logging.py

Start In: C:\Path\To\scripts\

🧑‍💼 Real-World Simulation Goals
This lab demonstrates:

Metadata enforcement aligned with DDMS and DoD audit standards

Zero Trust access policy implementation using YAML

Automated compliance workflows using Task Scheduler

Secure, documented, and validated data pipelines for mission systems

🧠 Ideal For:
DoD, Lockheed Martin, or Raytheon applicants

Junior to Mid-Level Data Engineers or Security Engineers

Portfolio showcase for metadata, governance, and scripting skills
